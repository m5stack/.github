We value every contributor. If you wish to contribute to the [GitHub](https://github.com/m5stack) repositories, you can participate in the following ways:
- 🔍 **Triage Open Issues**: Try to reproduce issues reported by other users and confirm whether you experience the same problem, or ask users for more details if needed. Identify duplicates, improve descriptions, and help users who need support.
- 🛠️ **Submit Fixes and Implementations**: Pick an open issue or feature request that you think you can implement, and submit a pull request with your solution.
- 🧪 **Test Open Pull Requests**: Try to run the proposed changes and report your success or failure. Testing on actual hardware takes time, and any help in this area will speed up our responsiveness in merging contributions.
